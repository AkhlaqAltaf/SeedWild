Explanations
Bee-friendly: This plant has a good nectar or pollen supply, which is especially good for honey and wild bees, as well as other pollinating insects. There are 500 different kinds of wild bees alone. Some crops are best approached by specialists, others by generalists.
Seed disk (portion content: 5 seed discs of ø10cm): This item is available in a special form for simple gardening. Here the seeds are fixed at appropriate distances between two thin pieces of carrier paper. To sow, this is then buried directly in the ground. The annoying job of separating or pricking out seedlings is no longer necessary. Whatever the variety, there are models for balcony planters, pots, or a row seeder.","DILL
 kr15
Versatile kitchen herb. Direct seeding preferable. Best to sow straight into the ground, although young plants are somewhat susceptible to slug damage. Same location should not be used too often.
Positive for pollinators: Yes
