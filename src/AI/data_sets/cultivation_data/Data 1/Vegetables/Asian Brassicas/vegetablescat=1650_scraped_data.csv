Explanations
Seed mat (portion content: 1 seed mat of 80x10cm): This item is available in a special form for simple gardening. Here the seeds are fixed at appropriate distances between two thin pieces of carrier paper. To sow, this is then buried directly in the ground. The annoying job of separating or pricking out seedlings is no longer necessary. Whatever the variety, there are models for balcony planters, pots, or a row seeder.","MIXTURE
as50
Mixture containing a diverse range of flavours. The large-leaf Red Giant variety matures a little slower, making it good for picking. Especially good for harvesting during the winter months or as an addition to a more rustic salad mix.
Colour: mixed
also available as seed mat: Yes"

Red-green leafy vegetable with a mild mustardy aroma. A nice addition to salads as baby-leaf or fully grown. The intensity of the color depends on the temperature - the warmer, the darker. Plants get very voluminous and need plenty of space."
