Explanations
Precision seeds: The seeds are calibrated and have an increased germination capacity. The seeds are sold per piece.
Seed tape (portion content: 1 seed tape of 5m): This item is available in a special form for simple gardening. Here the seeds are fixed at appropriate distances between two thin pieces of carrier paper. To sow, this is then buried directly in the ground. The annoying job of separating or pricking out seedlings is no longer necessary. Whatever the variety, there are models for balcony planters, pots, or a row seeder.","RUDI

Radish for outdoors, rather early to ripen, develops evenly. Root is resistant to splitting and turning woody. Bright red, fine root, strong foliage. Good for bunching.
