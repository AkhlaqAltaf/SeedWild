Here the seeds are fixed at appropriate distances between two thin pieces of carrier paper. To sow, this is then buried directly in the ground. The annoying job of separating or pricking out seedlings is no longer necessary. Whatever the variety, there are models for balcony planters, pots, or a row seeder.","ISHIKURA LONG WHITE
