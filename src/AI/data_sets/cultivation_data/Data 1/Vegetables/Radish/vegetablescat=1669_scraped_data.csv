Explanations
ProSpecieRara: This variety has been awarded by ProSpecieRara as a rare or old variety. ProSpecieRara is a foundation dedicated to preserving the diversity of rare plant varieties. In long-term cooperation with ProSpecieRara, Sativa is active in the important preservation and cultivation of these traditional varieties.
Seed tape (portion content: 1 seed tape of 5m): This item is available in a special form for simple gardening. Here the seeds are fixed at appropriate distances between two thin pieces of carrier paper. To sow, this is then buried directly in the ground. The annoying job of separating or pricking out seedlings is no longer necessary. Whatever the variety, there are models for balcony planters, pots, or a row seeder.
Conservation Breeding: For this variety Sativa practices conservation breeding in Rheinau. To ensure high-quality varieties, they must be maintained. They are regularly replicated and selected by their positive characteristics. In doing so the varieties are continually improved and adapted to growing conditions.","BLUE AUTUMN AND WINTER
