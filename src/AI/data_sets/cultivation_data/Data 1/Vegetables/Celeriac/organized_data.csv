Varieties that carry the Bioverita label are reproducible and fertile, and aim to offer an alternative to hybrid-seeds to professional gardeners.
Primed seeds: During priming, the germination process is activated for faster and more uniform emergence. The priming effect is only maintained for a few weeks. This seed should be stored cool (approx. 5°C), dry and dark. The primed seeds in our range are primed using a biocompatible technique.",white celeriac,,,,,,,ATHOS,null,"KS
