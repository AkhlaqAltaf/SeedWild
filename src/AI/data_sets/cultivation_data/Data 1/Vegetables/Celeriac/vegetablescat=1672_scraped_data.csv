Explanations
Bioverita: This variety is an organic, newly bred, variety. It has been cultivated from the very outset in organic conditions, to best adapt to organic cultivation. Varieties that carry the Bioverita label are reproducible and fertile, and aim to offer an alternative to hybrid-seeds to professional gardeners.
Primed seeds: During priming, the germination process is activated for faster and more uniform emergence. The priming effect is only maintained for a few weeks. This seed should be stored cool (approx. 5°C), dry and dark. The primed seeds in our range are primed using a biocompatible technique.","ATHOS KS

Pale-skinned celeriac with pronounced flavour. Highly resistant to bolting so suitable for early as well as normal cultivation. Tightly-knit, narrow root system facilitates harvesting and cleaning. For making bunches, selling fresh and storage. Variety bred by Sativa.
