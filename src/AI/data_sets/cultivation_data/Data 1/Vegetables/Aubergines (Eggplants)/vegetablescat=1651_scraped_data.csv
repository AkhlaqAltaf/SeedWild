Explanations
Bioverita: This variety is an organic, newly bred, variety. It has been cultivated from the very outset in organic conditions, to best adapt to organic cultivation. Varieties that carry the Bioverita label are reproducible and fertile, and aim to offer an alternative to hybrid-seeds to professional gardeners.
Conservation Breeding: For this variety Sativa practices conservation breeding in Rheinau. To ensure high-quality varieties, they must be maintained. They are regularly replicated and selected by their positive characteristics. In doing so the varieties are continually improved and adapted to growing conditions.","MELONGA
