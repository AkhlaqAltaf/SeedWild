**Seeds Wild AI System**

    This System Will be integrated Into Seeds wild SAAS-based System 

**Purpose Of this System**

    It is an AI System That contains Three main Purpose 
    1 . Recommendations For Seeds
    
        There are two ways to recommend Seeds 
        
        1. Content-Based 
            we are using a Large Data set for Training Our AI model uses the KNN model and Predict Seeds By inputs 
             'temperature', 'soil_num', 'water_level', 'moisture', 'humidity_rate_tens', 'rainfall_tens',
                'hydrometry_rate_tens', 'sunshine_rate_tens'
                The output of This Model will be SeedId and Seed Name 
        2. Collaborative Recommendation 
           There are Two Types Of this recommendation 
           1. Item Based 
              We will use some High-Level  AI models for This Recommendation And High 
           2. User Based 
              
           
                


    2.  Cultivation Plan For plant 
        
    3.  Different Alerts For Different Plants
